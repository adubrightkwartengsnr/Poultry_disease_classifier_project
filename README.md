# Poultry_disease_classifier_project
# Poultry_disease_classifier is a deep learning project that predicts 4 classes of the poultry (Coccidiosis" ,"Healthy", "New Castle Disease" ,"Salmonella") using fecal images of the poultry. I built a Convolutional Neural Network using datasets from Kaggle and deployed the model using a FastAPI.
